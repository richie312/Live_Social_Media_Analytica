"XUBeH7VQaFY","Didn&#39;t know the connection to Peet&#39;s, which I vastly prefer to Bucky&#39;s. But I&#39;ll drink instant coffee in a pinch."
"XUBeH7VQaFY","Starbucks overated.. rubbish taste ... And expensive."
"XUBeH7VQaFY","CNBC, Please stop these robot-like, high-speed, shrill-voiced deliveries with annoying pumped-up music  and sped-up videos that make us go nuts. Thanks in anticipation of your future consideration for the viewer / listener."

"XUBeH7VQaFY","Shanghai has most Starbucks in the world."
"XUBeH7VQaFY","My new found favor - Circle K cold brew and Americano mix. $0.99 refill price can’t beat that."
"XUBeH7VQaFY","all the comments are saying starbucks is successful because of &quot;white girls&quot; but this cant be further from the truth. as a starbucks barista, I would say almost all of the people I see are your average 20-60 year olds working normal, middle class jobs, who are all caffeine addicted. starbucks really makes it&#39;s money by profiting off of the widespread caffeine addiction we all have due to lack of sleep from school and working 9-5. we see just as many males as we do females, just as many ethnic people as we do non ethnic, even people who dont like coffee but come in for a tea or juice or small pastry. starbucks is not limited to just one demographic and if you really think white girls are why starbucks is popular or that starbucks is a &quot;white people&quot; thing then you&#39;re just ignorant"
"XUBeH7VQaFY","Idk <br /><br /><br />Wi-Fi?"

"XUBeH7VQaFY","Can you imagine  how many are spiked"
"XUBeH7VQaFY","I work in downtown DC, there’s 4 Starbucks shops, each one block away from each other. This new idea of a roastery sounds interesting, perhaps they should stop focusing on opening stores and pay more attention to the experience of the customers, who just buy Starbucks out of convenience of location but nothing else. Personally, I feel it’s overpriced and I rather buy a cup of coffee from a local coffee shop."
"XUBeH7VQaFY","coffee: 2$<br /><b>C</b> <b>O</b> <b>F</b> <b>F</b> <b>E</b> <b>E</b> : 20$ + tip"
"XUBeH7VQaFY","they put more caffeine to get you addicted"

"XUBeH7VQaFY","Not a single Starbucks in my country."
"XUBeH7VQaFY","Music was entirely too loud, but commentary and script was good"
"XUBeH7VQaFY","Howard Schultz claims he doesn&#39;t see color oh, well he doesn&#39;t see color he doesn&#39;t see me. The whole purpose of the racial training was to focus on actually seeing the people that support your product yet the leader  never understood the training that he provide for  the staff."
"XUBeH7VQaFY","Starbucks is like Apple. Middle class to rich people get them just to flaunt around"
"XUBeH7VQaFY","<U+0001F644> The Apple company of coffee."

"XUBeH7VQaFY","&quot;Expresso&quot; its called &quot;espresso&quot;"

"XUBeH7VQaFY","Starbucks coffee sucks... it&#39;s too light."
"XUBeH7VQaFY","but it fails in australia if i´m not wrong"
"XUBeH7VQaFY","Starbucks is nice but the coffee is bad"
"XUBeH7VQaFY","they missed about how it had fallen in Australia"
"XUBeH7VQaFY","If I get a grande cappuccino, it costs $3.15. I don&#39;t go to starbucks everyday, it&#39;s just a place to go if I want a treat or if I&#39;m on the road and my coffee machine didn&#39;t work. That and their cold coffee in the summer is really good as well. Everything is expensive nowadays. You just have to look for the better deals and treat your money like you would your phone. With care and caution."
"XUBeH7VQaFY","Completely failed in Australia because in Australia knows real coffee thanks to the Italians"
"XUBeH7VQaFY","music is annoying."

"XUBeH7VQaFY","One of my biggest pet peeves in life is when people try to tell me how to talk or what words to use.  Sorry Starbucks, I’m not Italian and neither are you, so why should I learn what the hell a venti means in order to pay too much for a bitter coffee? You can f right off."
"XUBeH7VQaFY","Voice is better as compared to other videos of CNBC"

"XUBeH7VQaFY","I&#39;m not a big brand person, but Starbucks has great coffee and good service (most of the time) and that&#39;s why they&#39;re successful...."
"XUBeH7VQaFY","The narrator lost me when she pronounced &quot;espresso&quot; as &quot;ex-presso&quot;"
"XUBeH7VQaFY","Ironic how this brand was invented by a bunch of American Jews, and completely failed in the land of the Jews."

"XUBeH7VQaFY","Somehow i don&#39;t like their coffee bean, it&#39;s like they lack a characteristic."
"XUBeH7VQaFY","Starbucks is textbook pricing strategy.  Overprice the common  coffee bean <br />yet make it affordable enough to the masses so people can feel important for 10 minutes...and repeat."
"XUBeH7VQaFY","Cool phota."
"XUBeH7VQaFY","what ? it is a business ? I thought it was a toilet !!!!"
"XUBeH7VQaFY","Westerners are known to Sell over priced products to the world and the high price creates a perception and making it a brand"
"XUBeH7VQaFY","So as long as they could make people health worst by too much sugar and chemicals, they continued same model, made billions .<br />Now market demands changed. So they are changing .<br />Cunning greedy brutes  who only cared for money while making people sick .. Shame"

"XUBeH7VQaFY","Stop. Saying. &quot;Expresso.&quot;<br /><br />I also found it interesting that there was little to no mention of growing competition from local coffee shops. More and more people are preferring local small businesses."
"XUBeH7VQaFY","Amazing."

"XUBeH7VQaFY","I read surprise and delight for a customer service class and I&#39;m glad I did. Recommend it to anyone involved with the customer service pipeline. What lean six sigma is to manufacturing."
"XUBeH7VQaFY","It sounds like Starbucks coffee is soaking up almost all the of Arabica coffee beans. Starbucks is too bitter, overpowering taste and it&#39;s way too expensive."
"XUBeH7VQaFY","Well India has Café Coffee Day if you want to burn your money…"
"XUBeH7VQaFY","I worked at Starbucks in 2017 and quit last year. They expect 200% of your output and pay only minimum wage. It was horrible. Never Again"

"XUBeH7VQaFY","How does someone at an organization like NBCUniversal produce a 7 1/2 min video on a coffee company and not pronounce “espresso” correctly?"
"XUBeH7VQaFY","Boringly written"
"XUBeH7VQaFY","CNBC, get the headline right. Starbucks is $22billion revenue a year. What is behind the $80billion you write?!"
"XUBeH7VQaFY","They are successful because they don&#39;t hire those disgusting goat fart curry smelling Indians and their kinds!"
"XUBeH7VQaFY","This great CNBC narrator doesn&#39;t even know how to pronounce &quot;espresso&quot; <U+0001F602>"

"XUBeH7VQaFY","One day I&#39;ll be opening my own beautiful &#39;&#39;coffee&#39;&#39; stores that would surpass Starbuck in terms of customer experience and design.

"XUBeH7VQaFY","I went the whole 2018 without buying Starbucks! I never been so proud of myself and with their racist batista&#39;s I don&#39;t plan to buy from them for a while"
"XUBeH7VQaFY","And sometimes it feels good to buy a cup of coffee. Because we live in a dull and repetitive life style. Yes, it is cooking cheap at home by 50 cents. However, sometimes it feels good to go to modern shopping mall areas or districts to buy a cup of coffee. I quite enjoy the shopping atmosphere it feels great. Starbucks provides this solution and it is successful. People demand this."
"XUBeH7VQaFY","Support local cafes and drink organic, not fast food coffee."
"XUBeH7VQaFY","Geez am I the only one who prefers to make at home instant coffee.. lol I even use some random Mexican brand."
"XUBeH7VQaFY","White girls"
"XUBeH7VQaFY","Just think about the original founders who sold Starbucks for just 3.8 million dollars..."
"XUBeH7VQaFY","Because suburban white girls."
"XUBeH7VQaFY","Because people is stupid and drink coffee because is cool. They don&#39;t like coffee actually, it&#39;s cool to be seen with that 10L bucket o sirrup , milk, sugar and 30 ml coffee in it."
"XUBeH7VQaFY","EXPRESSO<br />ESPRESSO!!!!!!!!"
"XUBeH7VQaFY","Fantastic business, addictive product, great environment to keep people there, and of course wifi. Winning."
"XUBeH7VQaFY","Peet&#39;s Coffee is locally roasted. Each pack is marked with the roasting date. I don&#39;t buy coffee that was sitting on the shelf for more than two weeks after roasting. It makes a huge difference in the taste."
"XUBeH7VQaFY","I always die inside when people pronounce espresso with &quot;x&quot; or a &quot;k&quot;. It happens so often."
"XUBeH7VQaFY","The problem is not many baristas follow the recipe of how to make a drink. Some are better than others. You never get the same taste. I’ve had many drinks with the shots burned."
"XUBeH7VQaFY","Coffee stinks. Tea tastes much better."
"XUBeH7VQaFY","Worst.  Coffee.  Ever"
"XUBeH7VQaFY","I love this narrator"

"XUBeH7VQaFY","On the highstreet in my sleepy British town just a few minutes walk away from my house there&#39;s a vegan cafe and no fewer than four cafe bars virtually next to each other.  Adding to this there&#39;s the &quot;big coffee&quot; chainstores Cafe Nero and now Starbucks who converted an abandoned bank bulding - MY old bank branch into a coffee shop! <br /><br />Even Costa (Starbucks greatest nemesis in the UK) tried to pitch in with a coffee vending machine in the Co-op supermarket across the road.<br /><br />How many coffee places can you fit into such a small area?  I&#39;m a coffee addict and I&#39;ve only visited that area twice to get coffee in the last 6 months - could the people want their coffee fix THIS much?"
"XUBeH7VQaFY","Why don’t sell sell good tasting coffee?"
"XUBeH7VQaFY","The narrator is saying expresso, not espresso. It&#39;s annoying."
"XUBeH7VQaFY","Hey you should how Nintendo does not exist in india"
"XUBeH7VQaFY","But, shows like this are too dull because it is too long. I fall asleep."
"XUBeH7VQaFY","Let us face it. Still many white collar people are buying. They work in high buildings with store around, they have high pay. They don&#39;t care about 5 dollars a cup."
"XUBeH7VQaFY","Too bad they don&#39;t know what a cappuccino is"
"XUBeH7VQaFY","What&#39;s interesting was that Starbucks also changed perceptions in Japan, of all things. Why? Because Starbucks stores in Japan are strictly non-smoking, in sharp contrast to the more traditional coffee shops in that country. As such, Starbucks surprisingly won a lot of converts, especially among women (if I remember the story correctly)."
"XUBeH7VQaFY","Long ad much?"
"XUBeH7VQaFY","Now if only they could stop burning the beans."
"XUBeH7VQaFY","Their sugary drinks is the reason why I no longer get Starbucks. Fix that and you&#39;ll get me back."
"XUBeH7VQaFY","Coffee bean is better"
"XUBeH7VQaFY","Starbucks payed how much for this advertisement?"
"XUBeH7VQaFY","“Espresso,” not “Expresso.”"
"XUBeH7VQaFY","Yea.. I&#39;ll stick with my vietnamese ice coffee"
"XUBeH7VQaFY","Starbucks gives you free refills. I usually buy 1 cup and get 2 free refills. That works out to less than $1 a cup."
"XUBeH7VQaFY","On UPenn’s campus there r 5 Starbucks all within a 10 minute walk of each other"
"XUBeH7VQaFY","You make it sound like espresso originated from the US and starbucks"
"XUBeH7VQaFY","CNBC completely neglected the fact that Starbucks is not just a coffee business; it&#39;s a real-estate business. Look at all the property they own. Even if they closed down stores, those property values had probably shot up in the past 40 years."
"XUBeH7VQaFY","just fyi the map of starbuckses in seattle at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUBeH7VQaFY&amp;t=5m28s\">5:28</a> is at least partially wrong"
"XUBeH7VQaFY","Starbucks sugar loaded coffees is like drinking battery acid"
"XUBeH7VQaFY","I won&#39;t give these liberals another dollar. Why haven&#39;t all good Americans boycotted them yet?"
"XUBeH7VQaFY","Why do people go to Starbucks everyday? Free wifi?<br />I&#39;d rather prefer to make a nescafe coffee at home. One can go to Starbucks once in a while to try something new. Going daily is a big loss unless you&#39;re a millionare."
"XUBeH7VQaFY","White girls. There I saved you the whole video fam"
"XUBeH7VQaFY","White girls"
"XUBeH7VQaFY","I’m so glad to have found local cafes in my area. Those have been a game changer for me in the world of coffee. Coffee for me isn’t just a some caffeine drink that you dump cream and sugar into, it is an art as well as a science."
"XUBeH7VQaFY","Expresso? Where did the ‘x’ come from?"
"XUBeH7VQaFY","Why CNBC Chanel viewers are so angry all the time."
"XUBeH7VQaFY","Americans are the most optimistic people on the planet, as they spend like crazy while being debt-ridden."
"XUBeH7VQaFY","CNBC is inexplicably obsessed with Starbucks and Apple"
"XUBeH7VQaFY","US always late......lol<br />Cafes have existed for centuries in many other countries. <br />Muricans had been drinking that poisoned pot from Diners...lol<br />Poor souls"
"XUBeH7VQaFY","Starbucks coffee is very similar to instant coffee. No thanks. My local Starbucks store closed within a year."
"XUBeH7VQaFY","Starbucks is cancer in a cup"
"XUBeH7VQaFY","That’s cool but they’re WiFi is like McDonald’s"
"XUBeH7VQaFY","Only 80B? Expected much higher to be honest. Starbucks cheapest item is a month Netflix subscription. Yet Netflix has 140B$ Market cap"

"XUBeH7VQaFY","Exact !!"
"XUBeH7VQaFY","It sounds nice to drink and support local cafes, but they&#39;re about as expensive, if not more expensive than a Starbucks. Also, unlike local cafes where if one closes then you&#39;re out luck, if a Starbucks closes, you always know there will be one within a reasonable distance."
"XUBeH7VQaFY","Ethically farmed and fair trade where possible <U+0001F60A>"
"XUBeH7VQaFY","Lol"
"XUBeH7VQaFY","+Dylan Ferrier I meant , people drink coffee at Starbucks because  it&#39;s cool. I drink coffee myself. Love it !!"
"XUBeH7VQaFY","nope, coffee tastes really good. And what you described isnt coffee, it&#39;s an American abomination. Most people just have coffee with milk or not even with milk, none of this sugar and syrup flavouring crap"
"XUBeH7VQaFY","+Nicholas Littlejohn I can totally see where you&#39;re coming from, it&#39;s a tough business to try and compete. I&#39;m glad there are still local coffee places that provide a unique experience that Starbucks can&#39;t replicate."
"XUBeH7VQaFY","Except it kills real, local coffee."
"XUBeH7VQaFY","Jason Santoro this has to do with training. For some reason my managers have scheduled all of the new people with people who have only been at my store for less than a month."
"XUBeH7VQaFY","Tea is far healthier."
"XUBeH7VQaFY","Both are unhealthy fast food."
"XUBeH7VQaFY","My coffee costs 0.2$"

"XUBeH7VQaFY","Lots of show off stupids. I&#39;m not impressed."
"XUBeH7VQaFY","Coffee is a drug."
"XUBeH7VQaFY","They have no education."
"XUBeH7VQaFY","+Nicholas Littlejohn yes because those people do not care. Well... Nothing to do or say about it."
"XUBeH7VQaFY","That&#39;s what they prey upon."
"XUBeH7VQaFY","Non smoking would be a real benefit for your health and for workers."
"XUBeH7VQaFY","So unhealthy, agreed! Lots of heavy ladies leave there, just look!"
"XUBeH7VQaFY","+Nicholas Littlejohn do they? I grew up with Starbucks and converted lol.<br />Does that mean you are team Starbucks?"
"XUBeH7VQaFY","They buy the cheapest coffee."
"XUBeH7VQaFY","Exactly!"
"XUBeH7VQaFY","actually it&#39;s esprexxo"
"XUBeH7VQaFY","And coffee costs like 5 cents a cup to make."

"XUBeH7VQaFY","That is correct. I think the same goes for McDonalds."
"XUBeH7VQaFY","+Nicholas Littlejohn Yup. All those chains, it&#39;s the reason why Subway is the most profitable in the business. Because they own property everywhere. But you&#39;re right, maybe some are leased out."
"XUBeH7VQaFY","I wonder how many they lease vs own. Fast food does this too."
"XUBeH7VQaFY","+BlownMacTruck and how&#39;s davidoff&#39;s coffee"
"XUBeH7VQaFY","Homer Simpson They both can taste horrible, but Nescafé is not only bad, but terrible for the environment, both in terms of waste and in terms of sourcing beans. Starbucks has far better sustainability practices, all the way down to trade prices with coffee suppliers. <br /><br />In addition, Starbucks at least uses better quality beans and has roasts that aren’t all burnt to a crisp."
"XUBeH7VQaFY","+BlownMacTruck True, but strabucks also uses heavily roasted commercial quality beans which some argue taste like burnt rubber.... It depends on which one you prefer. Personally I can barely taste any coffee aroma besides the very bitter burnt taste in starbucks."
"XUBeH7VQaFY","Karthikeyan Jayachandran A nescafe, seriously? Not only is their product terrible for the environment, the coffee is far worse. It’s not brewed at the right temperature and by the time the pods get to you, the beans are months old."
"XUBeH7VQaFY","This is why starbucks failed in Australia, we actually know what good coffee is and have local cafes in every single suburb. So no need to support a big, multinational billion dollar company when we can just support locals"
"XUBeH7VQaFY","Precisely!"

"XUBeH7VQaFY","Starbucks doesn&#39;t even exist over here in Adelaide, Australia so Starbucks hasn&#39;t &quot;won&quot; coffee at all. We like supporting our small business over here, and those small business owners make coffee and tea 100x better than the overly sweet and disgusting Starbucks &quot;coffee&quot;(I did try one with my mum, we both had a sip each and we promptly chucked it straight in the bin, there was NOTHING but sweetness and sugar it was the most disgusting &quot;coffee&quot; I&#39;ve ever had)."
"XUBeH7VQaFY","There are 7 SBX in my neighborhood that I frequent. I don&#39;t think I go to any one of them more than 25% of the time. It depends on mood (inside or outside), friendliness (small table or a large shareable table with 6 - 10 people). or other errands (N, S, E, or W), parking lot size and convenience, or working intent (work 4 hours or drive through)? Where I used to live we only had 1 SBX and 12+ independent shops within 8 blocks. I never went to the SBX because their coffee is the worst. You have to add a lot of half/half and brown sugar. At other coffee shops you can actually drink the coffee black like a fine wine. SBX is for WiFi and &quot;dessert coffee.&quot;"
